                    Kingdom Hearts is the first game in the series, released in 
                    Japan on March 28, 2002, for PlayStation 2.[1][2] Tetsuya 
                    Nomura served as game director, his first time in this 
                    position. Kingdom Hearts introduced the main characters 
                    (Sora, Kairi, and Riku) of the series, and established the 
                    plot's framework involving hearts and dark beings known as 
                    the Heartless. It also established the role of Disney 
                    characters in the series, with character cameos from the 
                    Final Fantasy series. Kingdom Hearts was released in North 
                    America on September 17, 2002,[1][2] and featured additional 
                    content that was not in the original Japanese version. The 
                    game was later re-released in Japan as Kingdom Hearts Final 
                    Mix on December 26, 2002.[1][2] Final Mix includes the 
                    content from the North American release and additional 
                    enemies, cutscenes, and weapons.[3]

                    Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is a direct sequel to the 
                    first game. It was released on the Game Boy Advance in Japan 
                    on November 11, 2004.[4][5] Chain of Memories was touted as 
                    a bridge between the two PlayStation 2 games, introducing 
                    and previewing plot elements that would be explored in the 
                    next game.[6] The gameplay system is a departure from the 
                    original and employs card game mechanics in real time. 
                     construct decks out of cards that correspond to different 
                     actions in battle, such as attacking or using magic. It was 
                     remade into a PlayStation 2 game titled Kingdom Hearts 
                     Re:Chain of Memories, which contains polygonal graphics 
                     instead of the sprites used in the original game. The 
                     remake was released in Japan as a second disc packaged with 
                     Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix on March 29, 2007, and in North 
                     America as a standalone game on December 2, 2008.[7][8]

                    Kingdom Hearts features a mixture of familiar Disney and 
                    Square Enix characters, as well as several new characters 
                    designed and created by Nomura.[77] In addition to original 
                    locations, the Kingdom Hearts series features many worlds 
                    from Disney films. Sora must visit these worlds and interact 
                    with various Disney characters to protect them from enemies. 
                    Often, his actions in these worlds closely follow the 
                    storylines of their respective Disney films. The main 
                    characters try not to interfere with the affairs of other 
                    worlds, as it could negatively affect the universe's order.
                    [78][79] Various Final Fantasy characters also make 
                    appearances within several worlds throughout the series. 
                    This includes Moogles, small creatures who are another 
                    common element in the games. They provide the player with a 
                    synthesis shop in order to create and purchase items used in 
                    the game. The main cast from The World Ends with You also 
                    makes an appearance in the series in Dream Drop Distance, 
                    and Kingdom Hearts III features characters from Pixar films 
                    such as the Toy Story series and Monsters, Inc., as well as 
                    Schwarzgeist, one of the bosses from Einhänder.[80][81][82] 
                    Nevertheless, the usage of Disney characters is not without 
                    restrictions. For example, Nomura had requested the use of 
                    Oswald the Lucky Rabbit in Kingdom Hearts III, but the 
                    response from Disney was that the character would be 
                    "too difficult" to use, with no further clarification or 
                    details from Disney.[83]

                    The series starts with Kingdom Hearts, where a boy named 
                    Sora is separated from his friends Riku and Kairi when their 
                    home Destiny Islands is consumed in darkness. At that moment 
                    Sora obtained a weapon called the Keyblade that allows him 
                    to fight creatures called Heartless, before ending up in 
                    another world, Traverse Town, where he meets Donald Duck and 
                    Goofy, two emissaries from Disney Castle sent to find the 
                    Keyblade wielder under orders from their missing king.[84]
                    [85] As the three band together and travel to save various 
                    worlds from the Heartless while searching for their 
                    companions, they encounter a group of Disney villains whose 
                    ability to control the Heartless was given to them by 
                    Maleficent, who enlists Riku's aid in seeking seven maidens 
                    called the Princesses of Heart whose power would open the 
                    way to Kingdom Hearts, the heart of all worlds.[86][87] 
                    Though eventually defeating Maleficent and reunited with 
                    Kairi after sacrificing himself to restore her heart to her 
                    body, Sora learns that Maleficent was manipulated by a 
                    sentient Heartless who possesses Riku and claims himself to 
                    be the Heartless researcher Ansem. Though Sora defeats 
                    Ansem, he is forced to trap Riku and Mickey in the Realm of 
                    Darkness after sealing the door and resolute to find them 
                    while Kairi remains at the Destiny Islands for their return.

                    The Kingdom Hearts games contain elements of action 
                    role-playing video games with hack-and-slash elements. 
                    The games are driven by a linear progression from one story 
                    event to the next, usually shown in the form of a cutscene, 
                    though there are numerous side quests available that provide 
                    bonus benefits to the characters. In most games, the player 
                    primarily controls the principal protagonist of the series, 
                    Sora. Sora is usually accompanied by Donald Duck and Goofy, 
                    who are artificial intelligence-controlled non-playable 
                    characters that aid Sora in battle. In the first and third 
                    game, their behavior can be altered to suit different combat 
                    objectives. The games feature real-time combat that 
                    incorporates physical attacks, magic, and summonings, though 
                    each game handles battles differently. The game also allows 
                    for items to be used on the field of battle to heal oneself 
                    or one's party members.
