            The national dish of Saudi Arabia, Kabsa, is the most comforting 
            dish packed with rice, meat, and so many warm flavors! It is 
            typically enjoyed in a circle with good company and everyone digs in 
            from the same plate. You can make it with lamb or seafood too but my 
            fave is with chicken and after one bite, you'll understand why you 
            could eat this dish day after day and not get sick of it!

        <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the ghee over medium heat. 
                Add minced garlic, ginger paste, tomato paste, and diced yellow 
                onion. Saute until the onions are translucent and the mixture is 
                fragrant, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add the whole spices (bay leaves, cardamom pods, cloves, 
                cinnamon sticks, dry lime, and green chili if using), and 3/4 of 
                the ground kabsa spice mix. Saute for another 2-3 minutes until 
                the spices are toasted and aromatic.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add the chicken leg quarters to the pot, skin side down, after 
                mixing it all. Sear the chicken until the skin is golden brown 
                and crispy, about 5-7 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Pour in the pureed tomatoes, mixing them well with the spice 
                mixture. Cover the pot and let the chicken cook in the tomato 
                mixture over low heat for about 30 minutes or until mostly 
                cooked. It can continue cooking in the oven.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Remove the chicken from the 
                pot and transfer to a baking tray. Sprinkle the remaining kabsa 
                spice mix over the chicken and place it in the oven to roast for 
                15 to 20 minutes or until crispy and golden on top and fully 
                cooked.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                While the chicken is roasting, add the rinsed basmati rice to 
                the pot with the tomato and spice mixture. Toast the rice for a 
                few minutes until lightly golden and fragrant.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Pour in the chicken broth and add salt. Stir well, then cover 
                the pot and let the rice cook over low heat until tender and 
                fluffy, about 20 minutes. Take off the heat and leave covered to 
                steam for another 10 to 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork and transfer it to 
                a serving platter. Arrange the roasted chicken on top of the 
                rice.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Garnish the Chicken Kabsa with optional garnishes such as 
                raisins, sauteed carrots, fried onions, slivered toasted 
                almonds, and chopped parsley.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Serve hot and enjoy your delicious Chicken Kabsa!
