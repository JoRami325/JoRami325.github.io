                <h3 id="Stroy">Story</h3>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time, two races ruled over Earth: Humans and 
                    Monsters. One day, war broke out between the two races. 
                    After a long battle, the humans were victorious. They 
                    sealed the monsters underground with a magic spell. The 
                    humans’ fear of monsters was based mainly on the monsters’ 
                    ability to absorb human SOULs. Trapped underground, the 
                    monsters explored their new environment and slowly set up a 
                    society there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the year 201X, a human child called Chara fell into the 
                    Underground. Chara was adopted by the Dreemurr family, the 
                    King and Queen of monsters and their son Asriel, and lived 
                    happily with them for some time. Chara devised a plan to 
                    collect human SOULs and deliberately ate buttercups to 
                    poison themself. Asriel absorbed Chara’s SOUL, and as a 
                    powerful composite being, they crossed the barrier and went 
                    to the human village. Assuming that Asriel had killed Chara, 
                    the humans attacked him. Chara’s SOUL urged him to fight 
                    back, but Asriel resisted. Mortally wounded, he stumbled 
                    back to the monster castle and died.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The king and queen were devastated, having lost both their 
                    children in one night. Asgore, the king of monsters, 
                    declared war on humans, and decreed that every human who 
                    fell would be killed. Once seven SOULs were collected, their 
                    power would be used to shatter the barrier and set monsters 
                    free. Then humanity would be destroyed, and monsters would 
                    live on the surface in peace. Disgusted at her husband’s 
                    actions, the queen, Toriel, exiled herself and disappeared.

                    <b>Frisk</b> is the playable character, main protagonist, 
                    and the eighth human in Undertale. After falling into the 
                    Underground, they venture to return to the surface, whether 
                    neutrally, genocidally, or peacefully. The latter case, the 
                    True Pacifist Route, is the only one where Frisk's name is 
                    revealed, emphasizing they are not the "fallen human" that 
                    is named by the player.

                    <b>Toriel</b> is the second major character the protagonist 
                    meets in Undertale. She saves the protagonist from Flowey 
                    and guides them through the Ruins, wishing to protect and to 
                    teach them to avoid the dangers of the Underground. Toriel 
                    is the former queen of the monsters, the ex-wife of Asgore, 
                    the mother of Asriel, the adoptive mother of the first 
                    human, and the first boss, as she guards the Ruins exit.

                    <b>Sans</b> (/sænz/[2]) is the older[1] brother of Papyrus 
                    and a major character in Undertale. He first appears in 
                    Snowdin Forest after the protagonist exits the Ruins. Sans 
                    is the deuteragonist of the Neutral and True Pacifist 
                    routes, in which he keeps an eye on the protagonist 
                    throughout the game. He is also the final boss of the 
                    Genocide Route.

                    <b>Chara</b>, also known as the fallen human, is the first 
                    human to fall into the Underground. Chara is their "true 
                    name" on the naming screen, though their name typically 
                    varies on what the player enters. They are distinct from the 
                    eighth fallen human, who is the protagonist of Undertale. As 
                    a major character, Chara's primary role is described through 
                    the Dreemurr's backstories, though Chara also appears at the 
                    end of the Genocide Route.

                <p>
                    Undertale is a role-playing video game that uses a top-down 
                    perspective. In the game, the player controls a child and 
                    completes objectives in order to progress through the story. 
                    Players explore an underground world filled with towns and 
                    caves, and are required to solve numerous puzzles on their 
                    journey.

                <p>
                    Undertale has three different main endings 
                    (Neutral, True Pacifist, and Genocide) and a 
                    fourth miscellaneous ending (Hard Mode).

                    Neautral Route: This ending occurs when one of these 
                    conditions are met:
