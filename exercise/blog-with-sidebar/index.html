                <h3 id="Stroy">Story</h3>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time, two races ruled over Earth: Humans and 
                    Monsters. One day, war broke out between the two races. 
                    After a long battle, the humans were victorious. They 
                    sealed the monsters underground with a magic spell. The 
                    humans’ fear of monsters was based mainly on the monsters’ 
                    ability to absorb human SOULs. Trapped underground, the 
                    monsters explored their new environment and slowly set up a 
                    society there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the year 201X, a human child called Chara fell into the 
                    Underground. Chara was adopted by the Dreemurr family, the 
                    King and Queen of monsters and their son Asriel, and lived 
                    happily with them for some time. Chara devised a plan to 
                    collect human SOULs and deliberately ate buttercups to 
                    poison themself. Asriel absorbed Chara’s SOUL, and as a 
                    powerful composite being, they crossed the barrier and went 
                    to the human village. Assuming that Asriel had killed Chara, 
                    the humans attacked him. Chara’s SOUL urged him to fight 
                    back, but Asriel resisted. Mortally wounded, he stumbled 
                    back to the monster castle and died.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The king and queen were devastated, having lost both their 
                    children in one night. Asgore, the king of monsters, 
                    declared war on humans, and decreed that every human who 
                    fell would be killed. Once seven SOULs were collected, their 
                    power would be used to shatter the barrier and set monsters 
                    free. Then humanity would be destroyed, and monsters would 
                    live on the surface in peace. Disgusted at her husband’s 
                    actions, the queen, Toriel, exiled herself and disappeared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometime between Chara’s death and the arrival of the player 
                    character, six humans fell into the underground, and all of 
                    them were killed, their SOULs collected by Asgore. Toriel 
                    tried and failed to save all of them. Also during this time 
                    frame, Gaster built the CORE, and fell into it. After Gaster 
                    dies, Alphys takes over as Royal Scientist. She starts 
                    experimenting with the substance called “determination,” 
                    which human SOULs have and monsters do not. She tries to 
                    create synthetic souls by injecting determination into the 
                    bodies of dying monsters. She assumed that the monsters 
                    would disintegrate and their SOULs would remain. Instead, 
                    the monsters come back to life, and then melt together into 
                    mutated amalgams. Alphys told no one about her horrifying 
                    mistake, and it heavily impacted her self-esteem. Meanwhile, 
                    her experiments led her to inject determination into a 
                    flower in Asgore’s garden, which happened to have Asriel’s 
                    dust on it. Asriel’s conscience was reborn in the flower, 
                    but, lacking a SOUL, he could not feel any compassion or 
                    empathy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Asriel called for his parents, but noticed with horror that 
                    he could not feel any love or affection for them. He tried 
                    to commit suicide, but woke up again in the garden. He soon 
                    realized that he could control timelines by being able to 
                    SAVE and reset. Calling himself Flowey, he started to play 
                    around. Sometimes he helped everyone around him (without 
                    feeling any true affection for them), and sometimes he 
                    killed them, just to see what would happen. Flowey became a 
                    ruthless sociopath, and eventually grew bored of other 
                    monsters, seeing them as nothing but scripted actors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Frisk, the player character, arrives in the Underground and 
                    is the first human to arrive in a while. Having more 
                    determination than Flowey, they inadvertently steal the 
                    SAVE/Reset ability. They have a run-in with Flowey, who 
                    tries to kill them, but is thwarted by Toriel. Toriel 
                    graciously adopts Frisk, but Frisk is anxious to get home. 
                    Toriel is reluctant to let Frisk go, because she is certain 
                    that Asgore will kill them. She fights Frisk to make them 
                    prove their worth, and when Frisk survives, she lets them 
                    go, if she is not killed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rest of the game depends heavily on the player’s 
                    actions. a Neutral run will have Frisk explore the various 
                    areas of the game, talking to monsters or killing them, or 
                    both, until they reach Asgore’s castle. Flowey will arrive 
                    and kill Asgore, if the player hasn’t already, and prevent 
                    Frisk from taking Asgore’s SOUL to get back to the surface. 
                    Absorbing the six human SOULs, Flowey becomes a godlike 
                    monstrosity and takes full control of the world, using his 
                    powers to torment Frisk. The SOULs rebel against Flowey, and 
                    Frisk survives. The following endings depend on the player’s 
                    actions, and to explain them all is an answer in itself. In 
                    any case, Asgore is dead, monsters are still trapped, and 
                    ne of the four remaining bosses (Toriel, then Undyne, then 
                    Mettaton, then Papyrus… then the Annoying Dog) will take 
                    over as ruler of the Underground until further notice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a Pacifist run, Frisk will have gone out of their way to 
                    make friends with every monster in the Underground, 
                    especially Papyrus and Undyne. After the Neutral ending 
                    following Flowey’s boss battle, Frisk will return to the 
                    Underground by loading their SAVE file, and befriend 
                    Dr. Alphys. Alphys will gain the confidence to face her 
                    mistakes, and resolve to bring the Amalgamates home to their 
                    families. When trying to leave the True Lab, the elevator 
                    malfunctions and Frisk is deposited in New Home. Reaching 
                    The End, Frisk is prevented from fighting Asgore by Toriel, 
                    and reunites with all of their friends. However, Flowey 
                    manipulated them all into gathering in one place, so he 
                    could steal their SOULs. Flowey absorbs not only the six 
                    human SOULs, but the SOULs of every monster in the 
                    Underground. He becomes Asriel Dreemurr, who fights Frisk in 
                    an attempt to make them stay, believing them to be Chara. 
                    Frisk manages to use their innate kindness to reach through 
                    the God of Hyperdeath and find the innocent child inside. 
                    Asriel reverts to his child form, and recognizes that Frisk 
                    is not Chara. He apologizes for his mistakes, and Frisk 
                    (usually) forgives him. He releases all of the SOULs, 
                    shattering the barrier, but dooming him to turn back into a 
                    flower. Frisk is once again reunited with their friends, and 
                    all of them ascend to the surface to start a new life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the genocide run, the player/Frisk ruthlessly slaughters 
                    all of the monsters in the Underground. When they kill 
                    Undyne, Undyne uses sheer determination to put herself back 
                    together (much like you during the Pacifist final battle) 
                    and become Undyne the Undying, a formidable enemy. However, 
                    eventually she is defeated, and Frisk continues to the 
                    castle, still going out of their way to hunt down and kill 
                    every single monster. Slowly, the vicious spirit of Chara 
                    awakens within Frisk and starts to possess them. Flowey 
                    appeals to them as a friend, and as a sibling, but realizes 
                    that Chara would be willing to kill him as well. Sans, who 
                    is aware of the player’s existence and godlike power, 
                    realizes that if Frisk/Chara should kill Asgore, the world 
                    would be permanently tainted. In a last-ditch effort to 
                    prevent destruction, he fights the player in a truly epic 
                    boss battle. However, he eventually fails, and 
                    Frisk/Chara/the player kills Asgore, and hacks Flowey to 
                    pieces. Chara approaches the player/whatever’s left of 
                    Frisk, admiring their lust for power and suggesting that 
                    they erase the world. Whatever the player chooses, Chara 
                    will take over anyway. The only way to restore the game is 
                    to sell your SOUL to Chara. If the player attempts a 
                    Pacifist run after completing genocide, it will be as normal 
                    until the very end, where Chara will murder everyone once 
                    they reach the surface.

                    <b>Frisk</b> is the playable character, main protagonist, 
                    and the eighth human in Undertale. After falling into the 
                    Underground, they venture to return to the surface, whether 
                    neutrally, genocidally, or peacefully. The latter case, the 
                    True Pacifist Route, is the only one where Frisk's name is 
                    revealed, emphasizing they are not the "fallen human" that 
                    is named by the player.

                    <b>Flowey</b> is the first major character that the 
                    protagonist encounters in Undertale. Flowey serves as the 
                    main antagonist for the Neutral and True Pacifist routes, 
                    and can be considered a deuteragonist for the Genocide 
                    Route. He provides an introduction to the mechanics of 
                    encounters by sharing "friendliness pellets," which are 
                    actually harmful bullets, revealing his philosophy of "KILL 
                    or BE KILLED." He serves as the final boss of the Neutral 
                    Route.

                    <b>Undyne</b> is a major character and the third boss in 
                    Undertale. Undyne leads the Royal Guard, which protects 
                    Asgore and patrols the Underground to find humans. She 
                    pursues the protagonist throughout Waterfall, though she is 
                    inadvertently thwarted by Monster Kid. If you choose the
                    Genocide route then you get a different version of Undyne
                    named <b>Undyne the Undying</b>

                    the lab in western Hotland. She is the incumbent Royal

                    disappearance of her predecessor. She is a major character

                    <b>Mettaton</b> is a major character and the fourth boss in 
                        Undertale. Mettaton is a robot with a SOUL, whose body 
                        was built by Alphys. He is the sole television star of 
                        the Underground. Mettaton poses as an entertainment 
                        robot turned human killing robot in Hotland, though he 
                        later reveals the truth to the protagonist at the end 
                        of the CORE. He has multiple form, but the last form is
                        only available through the Genocide Route, and can be
                        defeated in 1 hit. So not much of a battle.

                    <b>Chara</b>, also known as the fallen human, is the first 
                    human to fall into the Underground. Chara is their "true

                    varies on what the player enters. They are distinct from the 
                    eighth fallen human, who is the protagonist of Undertale. As 
                    a major character, Chara's primary role is described through 
                    the Dreemurr's backstories, though Chara also appears at the

                    Undertale is a role-playing video game that uses a top-down 
                    perspective. In the game, the player controls a child and 
                    completes objectives in order to progress through the story. 
                    Players explore an underground world filled with towns and 
                    caves, and are required to solve numerous puzzles on their 
                    journey.

                <p>
                    Undertale has three different main endings 
                    (Neutral, True Pacifist, and Genocide) and a 
                    fourth miscellaneous ending (Hard Mode).

                <p>
                    Neautral Route: This ending occurs when one of these 
                    conditions are met:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The protagonist does not befriend all plot pivotal 
                        characters
                    </li>

                <p>
                    The <b>Neutral Route</b> ends with the protagonist escaping 
                    the Underground alone. There are a variety of different 
                    possible variations of this ending depending on the choices 
                    made throughout the game.

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A Neutral Route has been completed. (A reset is not 
                        required, only reloading the player's SAVE file 
                        afterwards.)
                    </li>
                    <li>No monsters were killed throughout the game. (The 
                        protagonist cannot gain any EXP, and as a result, they

                    The True Pacifist Route ends with the barrier being broken, 
                    and the protagonist and the monsters of the Underground 
                    being able to leave. Additionally, this route features the 
                    True Pacifist Ending Credits.

                <p>
                    <b>The Genocide Route</b>ending occurs only when all enemies 
                    in each area (Ruins, Snowdin Forest, Waterfall, 
                    Hotland/CORE) are killed until no one remains. This includes 
                    all bosses.

                <p>Completing the Genocide Route leads to the destruction of the 
                    game's world. Upon re-launching the game after a completed 
                    Genocide Route, the first human asks the protagonist to give 
                    up their SOUL to them in exchange for the recreation of the 
                    world. This effectively acts in the same way as a True Reset 
                    from the True Pacifist Route, but it also permanently alters 
                    the endings of any later Genocide or True Pacifist endings 
                    (Soulless Genocide & Soulless Pacifist). Neutral endings 
                    after a Genocide Route are unaffected.

                    <b>Hard Mode</b> This mode is activated when naming the 
                    first human "Frisk". It is a difficulty enhancing mode that 
                    consists of slight dialogue changes and more difficult 
                    monster encounters (with some exclusive to this mode, while 
                    others can be found in the CORE). Hard Mode only lasts until 
                    the end of the Ruins, similarly to the Undertale Demo. After 
                    defeating Toriel, the Annoying Dog arrives to announce the 
                    end of Hard Mode.
