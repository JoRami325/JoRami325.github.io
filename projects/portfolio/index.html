                Hello my name is Jorge Ramirez! I am in the F.I.R.S.T program to
                be able to get a start on the career path to Graphics Design, 
                and Web developement. In my gallery page you will see my 
                different design that I have done through out the course. Some
                are even from my own work that I have done! I have learned how
                to use Adobe Express, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Lightroom. 
                Figma, and am now learning Coding. We are using Visual Studio to
                be able to create the HTML to create our website. I still have 
                so much to learn, and want to go into HTML Coding. I find Coding
                to be relaxing, and it drives me to try to find ways to do it 
                better, and more effienct every time I work. I will have
                in my gallery images of my works! Always looking to improve
                myself in everything that I have learned!
            </p>
